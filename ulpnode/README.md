Arduinode V1.3
==============

Very first early prototype of Utra Low Power Wireless Arduino Node. In fact it's amazing how often I use this board for testing, it runs on 3.3V, has RFM12B RFM69 connector, NRF24 style connector, I2C Oled connector and some sensors connectors.

It does not include the [Low Power][5] engine of ULPNode but it's a really cool testing board.

**This is not the final design**, this board was done to implement 1st testing and POC, it's posted there as reference only and as help on some Arduino Sketch I wrote that I use with this board. It also include 2 little battery power testing board with different version of MCP1640 DC/DC booster.
